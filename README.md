# SendStoryWhatsApp

**Code to send the entire Cantuña Story script to your friends or WhatsApp groups**

## Usage

- Open [ScriptSendHistoria.js](https://github.com/Christian-F-N/SendStoryWhatsApp/blob/main/SendWhatsApp/ScriptSendHistoria.js)

- Copy all content (click raw -> ctrl+a -> ctrl+c)

- In WhatsApp Web, open the browser console

⚠️ Important notice, in a recent update of Google Chrome, any script is prevented from being pasted in the Console.

**To workaround this issue, the developer console expects to receive a textual confirmation by writing in the console: "allow-scripts"**

After that, pasting and continuing script execution will be allowed.

Paste the code into the console and press Enter

Done
